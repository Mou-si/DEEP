This is a daily map recording each Antarctica polynya's area. It comes from the dataset of Daily Edge of Each Polynya in Antarctic (DEEP-AA). Each polynya is marked by it's ID in the map. The resolution of this dataset is 6.25km/1d. All parameter settings are recorded in ./Inputs.txt, and using the PolynyaIDsFinder_Guide (https://github.com/Mou-si/DEEP/tree/main/OverviewMapTool) with the ./OverviewMap.mat, you can quickly overlook the polynyas identified in the DEEP-AA. The DEEP-AA bases on ASI SIC data provided by the University of Bremen (https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.919778, and https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.898400). The ERA5 data  (https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.adbb2d47) and landfast ice masks (the dataset of Circum-Antarctic landfast sea ice extent, 2000-2018 - version 2.2, https://doi.org/doi:10.26179/5d267d1ceb60c) are also be used. More detailes are shown in https://github.com/Mou-si/DEEP. /%END_LINE%/
The codes used to create and evaluate this dataset are available at https://github.com/Mou-si/DEEP. You can get more details from this wedsite. /%END_LINE%/
Longitude-latitude grid comes from https://seaice.uni-bremen.de/data/grid_coordinates/. You can also find them at ./LonLat.nc. /%END_LINE%/
Each polynya"s area is masked by it"s ID. Polynya ID valid range: >0 [Format: YYWWWWSSX. YY: the two-digit year, WWWW: four-digit longitude (0-360Â°); SS: two-digit latitude; X: one-digit category-code (even number indicates coastal polynya, odd number indicates open-ocean polynya)]; land: -999/NaN; landfast ice (from Fraser): -100; open sea: -2; the other open waters (not polynyas): -1. /%END_LINE%/
List of polynya IDs in this day"s map. /%END_LINE%/
The flags indicate whether the polynyas in PolynyaIDs are coastal or open-ocean polynyas. /%END_LINE%/
The IDs in each line indicate that these polynyas are connected spatially at that time, and we have segmented them empirically. /%END_LINE%/
